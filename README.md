# weather-api

This app allows users to see five day weather data based on their current or any location. It also includes a UV index and uses local storage to store recent city searches. It uses Jquery and AJAX to generate dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

It is deployed here: https//vianvianc.github.io/weather-api/
